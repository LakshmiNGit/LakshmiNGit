# Lane Detection using LaneNet

This project implements a Lane Detection system using the LaneNet architecture. LaneNet is a deep learning-based model that performs both lane marking segmentation and instance segmentation. This README provides an overview of the code structure, functionality, and usage instructions.

## Introduction
Lane detection is a critical component in autonomous driving systems. It involves detecting lane markings on roads to enable a vehicle to understand its position within a lane and make appropriate driving decisions.

The provided code implements the LaneNet architecture, which consists of a frontend for feature extraction and a backend for segmentation. It utilizes TensorFlow for deep learning operations.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Other dependencies (specified in requirements.txt)

To install dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To use this code for lane detection, follow these steps:

Prepare your dataset: Ensure your dataset contains images with corresponding binary and instance segmentation labels for lane markings.
Configure the model: Adjust the configuration parameters in config.py according to your requirements, such as paths to datasets, training parameters, etc.
Train the model: Use the provided training script to train the LaneNet model on your dataset.
Evaluate the model: After training, evaluate the model's performance using the evaluation script.
Perform inference: Use the trained model for lane detection on new images or videos by running the inference script.
Structure
The structure of the codebase is as follows:

lanenet_model: Contains the LaneNet model implementation, including the frontend and backend components.
semantic_segmentation_zoo: Provides a base class for CNN models and other utility functions.
lanenet.py: Defines the LaneNet class, which orchestrates the frontend and backend processes.
config.py: Configuration file specifying model parameters, dataset paths, etc.
train.py: Script for training the LaneNet model.
evaluate.py: Script for evaluating the trained model.
inference.py: Script for performing lane detection on new images or videos.
